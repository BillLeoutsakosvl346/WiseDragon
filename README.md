# WiseDragon

**An AI-powered desktop assistant that sees and interacts with your screen through voice commands.**

WiseDragon is an Electron.js desktop application that combines OpenAI's Realtime API with computer vision to create an intelligent assistant that can see your screen, understand voice commands, and provide visual feedback through overlays. The application uses advanced AI models to identify UI elements and objects on screen, then points to them with precision-placed arrows.

**Features a stunning luxury black and gold interface** with animated logos, mystical background effects, and smooth golden glow animations that create an awe-inspiring user experience befitting an AI-powered assistant.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

WiseDragon follows the standard **Electron.js architecture** with clear separation between main and renderer processes:

### Main Process (`main.js`)
- **Electron app lifecycle management** - Window creation, app events, session management
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication) handlers** - Bridges renderer requests to backend tools
- **OpenAI Realtime API integration** - Manages ephemeral tokens and authentication
- **Tool execution orchestration** - Coordinates screenshot capture and overlay placement

### Renderer Process (`renderer/`)
- **WebRTC voice communication** - Real-time audio streaming with OpenAI's voice model
- **Luxury UI interface** - Black and gold themed design with animated logo, sparkle effects, and golden glow
- **User interface controls** - Elegant connect/disconnect buttons, status display, image preview
- **Function call handling** - Processes AI tool requests and displays visual feedback
- **Screen interaction visualization** - Shows screenshots and overlay results to user
- **Visual effects** - Animated dragon logo with orbital rings, pulsing golden glow from screen bottom, mystical background

### Preload Script (`preload.js`)
- **Secure API exposure** - Uses `contextBridge` to safely expose main process functions
- **IPC communication layer** - Handles `oai:getEphemeral` and `tool:execute` calls
- **Security isolation** - Maintains Electron's security model with context isolation

### Tool System (`tools/`)
The application uses a **modular tool architecture** where AI can execute specific functions:

- **Screenshot Tool** - Captures screen images using multiple methods (RobotJS, screenshot-desktop)
- **Overlay Tool** - Places precision arrows on screen using computer vision models
- **Session Management** - Organizes screenshots into timestamped conversation sessions

### Computer Vision Pipeline
1. **Screenshot Capture** - Multi-method fallback system for cross-platform compatibility
2. **Image Upload** - Secure upload to Google Cloud Storage with signed URLs  
3. **Vision Model Processing** - UGround for UI elements, Grounding DINO for real objects
4. **Coordinate Mapping** - Precise pixel coordinate calculation and arrow placement
5. **Overlay Rendering** - SVG-based arrows with automatic positioning and cleanup

## üé® User Interface & Visual Design

WiseDragon features a **luxury black and gold themed interface** designed to inspire awe and prestige:

### **Visual Elements**
- **Animated Dragon Logo** - 200px golden logo with intense shine animation that pulses every 4 seconds
- **Orbital Rings** - Two rotating rings around the logo with golden gradients and synchronized glow effects  
- **Sparkle Effects** - Six floating sparkles positioned around the logo with staggered animations
- **Mystical Background** - Blurred dragon imagery with darkening overlay for atmospheric depth
- **Golden Glow Effect** - Uniform golden light emanating from the bottom screen edge with bright corners

### **Interactive Elements**
- **Elegant Buttons** - Golden gradient connect button and outline disconnect button with hover effects
- **Smooth Animations** - Fade-in effects, shimmer text, pulsing status displays, and breathing glow
- **Responsive Layout** - Clean vertical layout with buttons above status, mobile-optimized design
- **Professional Typography** - Cinzel serif for titles, Inter for UI elements with golden color scheme

### **Technical Implementation**
- **CSS Animations** - Hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity changes for 60fps performance
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining visual impact
- **Optimized Rendering** - Efficient CSS with consolidated animations and minimal DOM elements

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new directory in `tools/`
2. Add `index.js`, `schema.js`, and `execute.js` files
3. Register the tool in `tools/index.js`
4. Define the OpenAI function schema
5. Implement the execution logic

### Vision Model Integration

- **UGround**: Best for UI elements (buttons, menus, text fields)
- **Grounding DINO**: Best for real-world objects (people, animals, objects)
- Add new models by creating new API integration files in `tools/overlay/`

### Testing

- Test on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Verify screenshot capture works with different screen configurations
- Test voice connection with various microphone setups
- Validate overlay accuracy with different vision models

## ü§ù Contributing

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Test thoroughly** on your platform before submitting
3. **Follow the existing architecture** - separate concerns between main and renderer processes
4. **Update documentation** when adding new features or tools
5. **Ensure security** - never expose sensitive APIs directly to renderer process
6. **Submit pull requests** with clear descriptions and testing notes

### Common Contribution Areas

- **New vision models** - Add integrations for additional computer vision APIs
- **Cross-platform improvements** - Enhance compatibility across operating systems  
- **UI enhancements** - Improve the renderer interface and user experience
- **Performance optimizations** - Reduce screenshot capture time or overlay placement latency
- **Tool extensions** - Add new capabilities like mouse control or text recognition

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"No capture methods available"** - Install RobotJS or screenshot-desktop: `npm install robotjs screenshot-desktop`
- **Vision model errors** - Check your HF_ENDPOINT and GCS_BUCKET configuration in `.env`
- **Voice connection fails** - Verify your OPENAI_API_KEY has Realtime API access
- **Overlay arrows don't appear** - Ensure proper screen permissions on macOS/Linux

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **macOS**: May require Screen Recording permissions in System Preferences
- **Linux**: RobotJS might need additional system dependencies
- **Windows**: Should work out of the box with proper Node.js installation
