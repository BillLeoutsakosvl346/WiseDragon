# WiseDragon - AI Voice Assistant with Visual Screen Control

WiseDragon is an Electron-based desktop application that provides real-time voice interaction with an AI assistant capable of seeing your screen and pointing to UI elements. The assistant can take screenshots, analyze visual content, and place directional arrows on your screen to guide your attention to specific interface elements.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application follows a three-layer architecture:

1. **Main Process Layer** (`main.js`) - Electron's main process that manages the application lifecycle, window creation, and secure communication with OpenAI's Realtime API
2. **Renderer Process Layer** (`renderer/`) - The user interface that handles voice communication, WebRTC connections, and real-time audio streaming
3. **Tools Layer** (`tools/`) - Modular system for AI-powered screen interaction capabilities

### Core Technologies
- **Electron** - Cross-platform desktop framework
- **WebRTC** - Real-time peer-to-peer audio communication with OpenAI
- **OpenAI Realtime API** - GPT-powered voice conversation with function calling
- **Sharp** - High-performance image processing for screenshot compression
- **RobotJS/screenshot-desktop** - Native screen capture capabilities

- **Coordinate Processing**: Handles 0-1000 scale normalization and pixel conversion
- **Smart Direction Logic**: Automatically determines arrow direction based on element position
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with detailed logging and fallback behavior

#### `overlay/` - Screen Annotation System

**`schema.js`** - Defines the `show_arrow_overlay` function:
- Accepts text descriptions of UI elements to locate
- One-shot operation with AI-powered element detection
- Invisible technical process from user perspective
- Comprehensive examples and guidelines for element descriptions

**`execute.js`** - Arrow Overlay Implementation:
- **Vision Integration**: Calls Modal API to detect element coordinates
- **Multi-Display Support**: Automatically detects target display
- **Dynamic HTML Generation**: Creates SVG arrows with customizable appearance
- **Transparent Overlays**: Always-on-top, click-through overlay windows

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Voice Activation Flow
```
User clicks "Connect" 
→ Microphone access requested
→ WebRTC connection established with OpenAI
→ Ephemeral session token obtained
→ Real-time audio streaming begins
→ AI responds when user pauses speaking
```

### 2. Screenshot Analysis Flow  
```
User mentions screen content/problems
→ AI calls take_screenshot()
→ Fast capture (RobotJS/screenshot-desktop)
→ Intelligent compression (Sharp processing)
→ Base64 transmission to AI
→ AI analyzes and describes visual content
```

### 3. UI Pointing Flow
```
User: "Click the Save button"
→ AI calls show_arrow_overlay()  
→ Fresh screenshot captured
→ AI provides element description to vision model
→ Modal API processes screenshot with UGround-V1-2B
→ Vision model returns precise coordinates (0-1000 scale)
→ System determines optimal arrow direction automatically
→ Arrow overlay created on screen at detected location
→ 8-second display with auto-cleanup
```

### 4. Tool Execution Pipeline
```
AI decides to use tool
→ Function call event received via WebRTC
→ tool:execute IPC message to main process  
→ Tool registry routes to appropriate handler
→ Tool executes with provided arguments
→ Result returned via IPC
→ Success/failure sent back to AI
→ AI continues conversation naturally
```
